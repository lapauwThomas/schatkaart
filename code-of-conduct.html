								<h3>safe and welcoming cycling festival for all</h3>
								<p>The following code outlines our requirements for participants’ conduct on and off the road during
                                the VeloTour Festival from 1 May 2020 to 3 May 2020 and is designed to offer a safe
                                and welcoming cycling festival for all regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation,
                                socioeconomic status, physical appearance, ability and religion (or lack thereof).
                                <br><br>Organizers do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form including offensive
                                language, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
                                harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                                inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop
                                any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                                <br><br>All participants, organizers and volunteers at the VeloTour Festival are required to
                                agree with the present code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the
                                event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe and
                                welcoming environment for everybody.
                                <br><br>Any conduct that breaches this code could result into actions organizers deem
                                appropriate, including warning or your removal from the VeloTour Festival and
                                organizers will not be liable to refund the cost of the festival or any expenses this
                                removal incurs.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>1. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS</h4>
								<p>All participants are required to observe the law wherever we go, both on and off the bike.
                                Failure to do so will result in removal from the festival.
                                <br><br>Participants must follow all traffic rules and road rules of the <a rel="license" href="https://wegcode.be/">Belgian Traffic Code</a>. This means you have the same responsibilities as road users and must obey all traffic signals such as red lights, stop signs, etc. just as you would driving a bike on your own.
                                <br><br>Police escorting may be applicable for some parts of the tour. Instructions of the Police must
                                be followed.
                                <br><br>There's a liability and physical damage insurance during the event. Yet, with your registration you agree and confirm that you participate at your own risk and responsibility. You will be asked to sign a disclaimer on the first day to waive any liability claim towards the organisers.</p>
                                
                                <h4>2. GENERAL CONDUCT</h4>
								<p>Welcome to My Garden is a network of citizens offering free camping spots in their gardens to slow travellers. It is a not-for-profit initiative set up by a small team of volunteers, mostly outdoor enthusiasts and some indoor enthusiasts (i.e. developers). 
								<br><br>			
								The idea was born thanks to the coronavirus: if we’re not allowed to travel abroad, how can we create adventure closer to home? What if this summer could make you discover your own country in ways you’ve never done before?
								<br><br>	
								This is the perfect time to discover what Belgium is all about, from Flanders to Wallonia passing through Brussels. Adventure begins at the end of the roads we know. So pack your bag and let Belgium surprise you this summer - and beyond! 
								<br><br>	
								So how does it work? Welcome to My Garden connects citizens who want to offer their garden to hikers and cyclists who need a basic camping spot for the night. After you’ve made arrangements with your host, walk or bike to your camping spot. Introduce yourself, pitch your tent for the night, and continue on your hiking or biking trail the next day. And have a great time, of course! 
								<br><br>	
								The source code of this project is available on GitHub. Any suggestions to make it better? Feel free to contribute! We are also looking for all kinds of people to join our team, so please drop us a line if you think you can help us out. 
								<br><br>	
								For now, Welcome to My Garden focuses on Belgium. However, we’re hoping it can travel beyond its borders. If you want to set it up in your own country, do get in touch! It would be awesome if we could make this a European or even global project. 
								<br><br>	
								Happy summer!
